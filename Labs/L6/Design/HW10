 In Herman Tavani's Ethics and Technology, at the end of chapter 8 do Questions # 4, 6, 7, 12 - 15, 21, 26, and both Scenarios.


 4. Describe the difficulties that arose in determining
whether computer software (as a kind of intellec- tual object) should be eligible for the kinds of legal protection (i.e., copyrights and patents) that are typically granted to authors and inventors of crea-
tive works.


6. What is the SBCTEA, and why is it controversial? 


7. What is the DMCA, and why is it controversial?



12. Describe some of the jurisdictional issues/challenges involving intellectual property laws. What roles do TRIPS and WIPO play in addressing these issues?

13. Describe the rationale behind the labor theory of property. Is it a plausible philosophical theory when used to justify intellectual property rights?

14. What is the utilitarian theory of property? Can it jus- tify the protection of software?



15. How does the personality theory of property differ from both the labor and the utilitarian property theories?


What are PIPA and SOPA, and why are they
controversial?


26. In Chapter 5, we saw that privacy advocates argue for greater control of personal information by individuals, while many in the commercial sector argue for increased access to that information. In this chapter, we saw that those positions have become reversedâ€” entrepreneurs argue for increased control over the flow of information on the Internet, while ordinary users argue for greater access to that information. Is there an irony, perhaps even an inconsistency, here? Can this inconsistency be resolved in a logically coher- ent manner? How? Explain.
