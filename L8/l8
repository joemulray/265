Interfaces

Q1
Hide implementation details: Implimintation that is hidden from the user so that he or she is not affected from any change to the code
Choose a small orthogonal set of primitives: Limit code to a minimal having functions or methods performing same tasks and capabilities 
Don't reach behind the user's back: User interface should not involve anything that the user is unaware of, only what is stated in in the requirents.
Do the same thing the same way everywhere: User interface should be consitent across all platforms and functionality, along with programming style.

Q2
Code is unclear, bad variable names, can only have a line buffer with 200 characters with because of the allocated memory, along with limited to 20 feilds. 

Q3
Programming style, variable names are more clear easier to follow code, includes comments etc.
Functions are task orientated makes easier to modify existing code

Q4
You cannot parse 2 different CSV files at the same time cause the way the program is written you cannot it reads each line individually, does not used stdin, the use of threading would be a good implimentation here. 

Q5
No the C++ implimentation does not solve these problems, solves the issue of limited allocated memory in the original C program, still does not handle errosrs empty fields.

Q6.
Yes it does adhere to the guidelines for a good i/f.
