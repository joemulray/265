CS265 Assignment 1

No other files needed to run files. For problem two wrote two files one that used a temp file to store all the emails 
and use a grep from there, and other one to use find on the current archive directory and word count the highest threat.
Submitted the wc find file, other program was taking substantially longer almost five mintues to run. Got same output just figured 
faster was better.
